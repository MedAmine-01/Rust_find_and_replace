Alice went to the market. Alice bought some apples and oranges.
 Alice met her friend Bob at the market. Bob asked Alice if she wanted to join him for lunch.
 Alice agreed, and they both went to a nearby cafe. At the cafe,
 Alice ordered a sandwich and a coffee. Bob noticed that Alice seemed a bit tired.
 Alice explained that she had been working late the previous night.
 After lunch, Alice and Bob decided to take a walk in the park.
 The fresh air made Alice feel much better. They chatted about their plans for the weekend,
 and Alice mentioned she wanted to visit her parents.
 Bob wished Alice a good visit and they parted ways. Later that evening,
 Alice reflected on her day and felt grateful for the time spent with Bob.
