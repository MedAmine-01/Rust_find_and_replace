Annie went to the market. Annie bought some apples and oranges.
 Annie met her friend Bob at the market. Bob asked Annie if she wanted to join him for lunch.
 Annie agreed, and they both went to a nearby cafe. At the cafe,
 Annie ordered a sandwich and a coffee. Bob noticed that Annie seemed a bit tired.
 Annie explained that she had been working late the previous night.
 After lunch, Annie and Bob decided to take a walk in the park.
 The fresh air made Annie feel much better. They chatted about their plans for the weekend,
 and Annie mentioned she wanted to visit her parents.
 Bob wished Annie a good visit and they parted ways. Later that evening,
 Annie reflected on her day and felt grateful for the time spent with Bob.
